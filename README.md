Examples of using OpenSSL command line tool.

The `coreutils` package is needed which is available on most Linux distros.  On OSX to install with brew:

```
brew install coreutils
```

Note: Some commands could be combined into one using OpenSSL, for example encryption and base64 encoding, or hashing and signing, but they've been split intentionally in the examples to demonstrate the stages required, and to make more obvious the inputs and outputs of each stage.
